### Instructions
----
As you start the app you will land on the homepage leaving you two options. Register as a new user or login. To register, just click the link that says register and follow the form. Afterwards, you will be brought back to the login screen to use the information you just created to login. Once you login, you will see your profile.

### Next Version 
----
As you can probably tell, this app is not complete. I had a hard time figuring out encryption in a couple hours and couldn't successfully use it in my app. The next version of this app will use RSA and AES encryption. It will be awesome. I just need a little bit more time to develop.
